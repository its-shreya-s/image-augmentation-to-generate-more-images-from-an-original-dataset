### Image augmentation to generate more images from an original dataset

"ImageDataGenerator" class from Keras is a tool for generating augmented versions of images by applying transformations such as rotations, shifts, shear, zoom, and flips. This is a form of data augmentation.

### The code is described below:

1. Importing libraries: In the code, various libraries have been imported. 'os' is used for directory operations, 'numpy' for array operations, 'matplotlib.pyplot' for plotting, and 'keras.preprocessing.image' for image loading and augmentation.
   
2. Setting Directory Paths: 'original_dataset_dir' and 'augmented_dataset_dir' variables are placeholders for the paths to the directories containing the original images and where the augmented images will be saved. They have to be filled with appropriate paths. 

3. Creating an ImageDataGenerator Instance: This creates an ImageDataGenerator instance configured with various augmentation parameters:
- rotation_range=40: Randomly rotates the image by up to 40 degrees.
- width_shift_range=0.2: Randomly shifts the image horizontally by up to 20% of the width.
- height_shift_range=0.2: Randomly shifts the image vertically by up to 20% of the height.
- shear_range=0.2: Applies random shearing transformations.
- zoom_range=0.2: Randomly zooms into the image by up to 20%.
- horizontal_flip=True: Randomly flips the image horizontally.
- fill_mode='nearest': Fills in newly created pixels after a transformation with the nearest pixel values.

4. Loading and Augmenting Images: The code iterates over each image file in 'original_dataset_dir' and does the following:
- It loads the image and converts it to a NumPy array.
- The array is reshaped to include an additional dimension, making it suitable for processing by ImageDataGenerator.
- The 'datagen.flow()' method is used to generate augmented images from the original image.
- It saves these images to augmented_dataset_dir with a prefix 'cashew' and in 'jpeg' format.
- The loop generates and saves 8 augmented images per original image.
